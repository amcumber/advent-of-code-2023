# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my solutions to the
[advent of code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).  Rules and input files
are specifically not included with respect to the
[wishes](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about) of the Advent of Code author. If
interested in the rules that these solutions provide, please refer back to the
[advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) and thanks again for providing
interesting puzzles to solve using any language the user wishes.

The solutions provided are intended to use core python with no add ons (we'll
see how we do). Solutions are generated using test-driven-development in an
effort for me to become a stronger TDD developer and increase my knowledge of
the built-in tools python provides. One exception is that testing is used with
the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) package. This is in part due to the
simplicity of the tool and the intended development method.
